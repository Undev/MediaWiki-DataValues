# ValueView

"ValueView" introduces the jQuery.ui.widget based frontend component jQuery.valueview which allows
to display and edit data values defined by the "DataValues" extension. When added as a dependency in
a resource loader definition, the following components introduced by this extension will be available:

* jQuery.valueview: Widget definition for displaying and editing data values. Each data value which
  should be supported by the valueview widget has to be implemented as a jQuery.valueview.Expert.
* jQuery.fn.valueview: jQuery widget bridge to instantiate a jQuery.valueview widget in the DOM.
* mediaWiki.ext.valueView: Object representing the "ValueView" MediaWiki extension.
* Support of valueview for some basic data value types. These valueview experts can be found in
  jQuery.valueview.experts.<constructor-name>.
* other jQuery extensions required by this library which are not available in MediaWiki itself:
  - jQuery.eachchange
  - jQuery.inputAutoExpand
